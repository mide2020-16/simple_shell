# Simple Shell Project

This is a simple shell project, a basic implementation of a command-line shell in C programming language. The shell supports common features such as executing commands, managing environment variables, and handling user input.

## Features

- **Command Execution**:  Execute external commands by entering their names in the shell.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Manipulate environment variables, including setting, getting, and unsetting.
- **Built-in Commands**:  Includes built-in commands such as `cd` for changing the current directory.
- **Input Redirection** :  Redirect input from files to commands.
- **Output Redirection** : Redirect output from commands to files.
- **Piping** : Connect multiple commands through pipes.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C Library

## Compilation

Compile the shell using the provided command:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## Usage

Run the compiled executable: `./hsh`
